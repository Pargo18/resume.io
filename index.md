# Panagiotis (Panos) Mavritsakis
<h2 class="typewriter gold-link">Data Scientist | Engineer</h2>

I am Panos, a multidisciplinary professional with a background in Water Management from TU Delft and a strong passion for data-driven problem solving. I combine domain expertise in environmental systems with skills in data science, programming, and analytical thinking to deliver practical, efficient solutions. Whether it's building insightful dashboards, automating workflows, or developing models, I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable outcomes. I'm open to freelance opportunities in tech, sustainability, and everything in between.
