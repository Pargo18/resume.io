title: "Automated Reliability Platform for Linear Infrastructure"
permalink: /projects/ML-deployment/
---

This project involved the design and development of a **Python-based automation platform** tailored for linear infrastructure engineering workflows. The platform integrates multiple components to provide a robust solution for data ingestion, modeling, analysis, and stakeholder interaction.

The system features:

- **Live data ingestion** every 5 minutes from operational sources
- Automated **reliability assessments**
- ‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù scenario modeling to evaluate potential system responses
- **Predictive maintenance models** powered by machine learning
- **Interactive dashboards** for real-time results and reporting

It was designed to run in **scalable Docker containers**, making deployment and parallel execution highly efficient.
