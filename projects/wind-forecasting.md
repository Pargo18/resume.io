permalink: /projects/wind-forecasting/
---

As the world transitions to renewable energy, accurately forecasting wind energy generation becomes crucial for grid reliability and planning. This project, presented at the **European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly 2020**, applies **machine learning techniques to predict wind power generation** using atmospheric variables from reanalysis datasets.

By engineering predictive environmental features and testing a range of ML algorithms, the study evaluates how well data-driven models can support energy forecasting at scale.

## Project Highlights

- ðŸ’¨ **Wind Energy Forecasting**: Focused on predicting wind power generation based on environmental conditions.
- ðŸ“Š **Environmental Inputs**: Used reanalysis data such as wind speed, temperature, and air pressure.
- ðŸ§  **ML Algorithms Tested**: Evaluated models including Random Forests and Support Vector Machines.
